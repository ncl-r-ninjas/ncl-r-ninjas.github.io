**Project title**: Upscaling upland hydrology-vegetation bi-directional interaction in the Rede catchment


**Project Supervisors**: [Dr. R. Sanderson]((https://www.ncl.ac.uk/nes/staff/profile/roysanderson.html#background)), [Prof S. Rushton]((https://www.ncl.ac.uk/nes/staff/profile/stevenrushton.html#background))

**Info**: My research looks at distribution of vegetation communities, developing generalisable methods to use pseudoquadrats as a supplementary or complimentary aid were vegetation survey data is limited. This will allow upscaling from small-scale to large-scale vegetation distribution, using the British National Vegetation Classification as a case study.  For reliable upscaling, abiotic factors, such as soil pH, hydrological networks and herbivore grazin will be used as precursors for trend study.
