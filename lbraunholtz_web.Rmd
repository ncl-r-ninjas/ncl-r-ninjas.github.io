**Project title**: Roads through rainforests: measuring and mitigating biodiversity impacts


**Project Supervisors**: [Dr Marion Pfeifer](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/nes/staff/profile/marionpfeifer.html#publications), [Dr Phil McGowan](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/nes/staff/profile/philipmcgowan.html#background)

**Info**: The aim of my project is to assess the impact of roads on biodiversity in primary tropical forests of Brunei Darussalam. In these understudied forests, ongoing road expansion and the associated threat of poaching is unquantified and potentially devastating wildlife populations. A collaboration between Newcastle University and Universiti Brunei Darussalam, this project will study changes in mammal and amphibian communities at increasing proximity to roads.
