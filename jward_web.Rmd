**Project title**: Modelling sociality in Carnivores

**Project Supervisors**: Prof S. Rushton, Dr A. Mill, Prof P. Robertson

**Info**: My project looks at how and why animals form groups and the relationships between different factors that are thought to influence sociality in carnivores. My research has a particular focus on behaviours relating to food acquisition, territorial defence and predator defence as well as investigating the evolutionary consequences of sociality. My project examines these relationships by using a range of modelling approaches in order to understand how and why animals form groups so that we can better understand how to conserve and protect threatened carnivore species.
