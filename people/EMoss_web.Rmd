**Info**: My project is looking at how climate warming might affect the interactions between pollinating insects and the plants that they feed from. I ran a field-based, open-air climate change experiment that used infra-red heaters to continuously warm soil and vegetation directly. I surveyed the wildflowers and the insects that visited them and used the data to construct replicated species interaction networks. I also collected seeds from these plants so I could investigate how pollination services are affected.

**R**: I have used R extensively during my PhD to analyse my data; this has mainly involved using GLMs or GLMMs, and some community analysis. As well as standard network analysis using structural metrics like connectance and weightedness, I have also generated temporal networks that I can analyse to investigate seasonal dynamics like interaction turnover. I have developed a keen interest in creating swanky graphs to display my data and have so far been using ggplot2, bipartite and HiveR.
