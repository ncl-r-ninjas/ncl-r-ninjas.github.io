**Info**: Reef predators, such as sharks, snappers and groupers, present us with a conundrum of how they are sustained in oligotrophic tropical waters. It may be that the open ocean provides an important source of nutrition to coral reef communities and reef predators may act as mobile links connecting adjacent marine ecosystems. My PhD uses a combination of different methods; underwater visual census, baited remote underwater videos, bulk and compound-specific stable isotope analysis and acoustic telemetry, to determine the reliance of coral reef predators on oceanic productivity. Providing information on reef predators' resource and space utilisation will contribute to their conservation and management. Ultimately greater knowledge of coral reef food webs is crucial for understanding the impacts that climate change will have on these marine ecosystems.
