**Info**: My PhD research aims to determine the viability of the landscape matrix for free-roaming lions in East Africa. Anthropogenic pressures, primarily loss of habitat and prey, as well as conflict with humans, have led to precipitous declines in lion numbers and range over the past century. Although protected areas are key to lion survival, much of their range lies outside these areas in community land where they must coexist with pastoralist communities and their livestock.

I will be using databases on lion range and abundance and remotely sensed data on habitat and land use attributes to assess the current and future viability of this landscape for lions. In addition, I will be mapping hotspots of human-lion conflict and their likely outcomes through collaboration with partners in East Africa including the Ruaha Carnivore Project (http://www.ruahacarnivoreproject.com/).
