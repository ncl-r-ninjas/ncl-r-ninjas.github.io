**Info**: I am a post-doc in the Modelling for Evidence and Policy group at Newcastle University. I like to solve problems by combining different types of knowledge from different sources, for example merging different (usually large) datasets or combining scientific findings through systematic reviews. I use R for data manipulation, data visualisation and use machine learning methods. I have taught basic R skills and data visualisation to undergraduate and PhD students.

My current research focuses on global policies for biodiversity conservation. In particular, I look at how we can achieve UN Sustainable Development Goal 15, Life on Land, whilst achieving the other 16 Sustainable Development Goals. For my PhD I considered when we need more data to make decisions in conservation and when we need to act, and then applied this to different case studies from predicting extinction risk of plants, to modelling why some areas are better for tiger conservation than others.
