**Research area**: Threatened species conservation and policy

**Info**: I'm a post-doctoral researcher in conservation and ecology, working to provide the scientific evidence needed to inform international conservation policy. My work here at Newcastle focusses on species conservation, and I aim to understand why, as a global community, we are failing to prevent species extinctions, and what we can do to better conserve endangered species. 

My background is in macro-ecology, with a focus on patterns and drivers of species distribution changes. I have worked primarily with citizen science data, using it to quantify and understand species distribution change, and applying the data to species distribution models to project responses to climate change. 

**R**: My research is almost entirely desk based, and I often work with huge datasets, so R is my primary research tool. In fact, I cannot think of a single paper I have written or project I have been involved in so far that has not required R! I have used R for data manipulation, handling spatial data, statistical analyses, fitting species distribution models (including MaxEnt and occupancy models run in OpenBugs from R), downloading data from online databases, topic modelling, network analysis, preparing figures and, as of now, creating webpages. 

**Publications**: To see the products of all this R-based work, check out my [university webpage](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/nes/staff/profile/louisemair.html) or [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UeMGAaAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) page.
